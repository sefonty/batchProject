1) In the file XmlParsing.java, the line just after the try block starts,its mentioned -
File f = new File("C:\\Users\\Papillon@88\\Desktop\\OperatingSystems\\batchProject\\work\\batch1.xml");

the above file path is the path where all the batch.xml files reside.

2) you need both the files - XmlParsing.java and ProcessesException.java to run the XmlParsing.java file in eclipse.ProcessesException.java is simply a class file.
